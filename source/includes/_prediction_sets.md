# Prediction Sets

A prediction set is the primary model for storing forecasts within Cultivate Forecasts. A prediction set will contain one prediction for each answer in the question.

This forecast stream will be provided on the `control` subdomain domain (e.g. `https://control.hfc-staging.com`), not on your assigned subdomain.
