# External Prediction Sets

## External Prediction Sets Creation

This API is for submitting forecasts generated outside of Cultivate Forecasts, which will then be scored when the question/answer resolves.

Each submission is known as an `ExternalPredictionSet` and each prediction set contains 1 or more predictions. If a question has 3 possible answers, then a prediction set for that question should contain 3 predictions. If a question is a binary question (ie. a Yes/No question), then the prediction set should have a single prediction (and the opposing value is automatically calculated). Other than binary questions, all predictions in a prediction set should sum to 1.0 (ie. in a 3-option question, answer a: 0.2, answer b: 0.3, answer c: 0.5).

Each prediction set should also contain information about the method used to generate it. Each method is tracked by the platform with a model known as an `ExternalPredictor`. You must embed the name of your external predictor within the forecast submission, via the `external_predictor_attributes.method_name` attribute.

Submissions should also contain a `metadata` field. This string should contain JSON-formatted information about how the forecast was generated and any associated parameters that were used to generate it.

### Official vs. Experimental Method Designation

The first time you submit a forecast for a method, you should designate whether the method is an official or experimental method. Once this designation has been set (via the first forecast), it cannot be changed.

To designate a method as experimental, you should set `exclude_from_best_method` to `true` in the `external_predictor_attributes` of your request body. The request body example to the right shows an example of this. If you want a method to be considered an official method, you can omit the `exclude_from_best_method` or set it to `false`.
